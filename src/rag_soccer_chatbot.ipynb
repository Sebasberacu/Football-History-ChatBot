Blatter is at least on firmer ground here than on his\\nexcursion into the prehistory of play. Certainly, the China created and ruled\\nby the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 221 CE) widely played a game called cuju,\\nsimply translated as kick-ball. The technological and social precocity of\\nancient China is not in doubt; the Chinese invented a lot of things first. The\\nemergence of settled societies, cities and social hierarchies provided the\\nframework in which spontaneous play could be organized into rule-bound\\ncontests, and China came to all of these things early. In the initial attempts\\nby nationalist historians of the 1920s and 1930s to write a Chinese history\\nof sport these truths were applied to football.2 Claims based on stories of\\nthe cuju-playing Yellow Emperor dated his political and sporting career as\\nearly as the third millennium BCE. The claims however were an attempt to\\ngive historical foundation to mythology, relying on legendary epics written\\njust before the emergence of the great Han dynasty in the second century\\nBCE. It seems most likely that cuju, although played in the era of the\\nWarring States (in the third and fourth centuries BCE), was first formalized\\nas an organized sport under the Han. The game was played with a stitched\\nleather ball stuffed with fur or feathers, though some accounts suggest\\nhemp. There were two teams on a marked pitch with goals at the two ends.\\nIt appears handling and rough tackling were allowed, but kicking was an\\nimportant form of propulsion. In some accounts the goal was moon- or\\ncrescent-shaped, in others it was described as a hole in a silk sheet hung\\nbetween bamboo posts. The game was clearly popular among the Royal\\nHousehold - Emperor Wu Di has been described as both enthusiast and\\nexpert. But the game’s home was most likely to have been in the army\\nwhere it became an element of both training and recreation; some suggest\\nthat it warded off the leg numbness suffered by cavalry after a long ride.\\nUnder the subsequent imperial dynasties - the Tang (618-907 CE) and the\\nSong (960-1279 CE) - the game continued to be played but its form\\nchanged. The ball itself was transformed as players adopted the more\\ntechnologically advanced but less physically robust hollow ball. It was\\neasier to control, but less suited to combative mêlée.

Bai Da was closer to the original Han version of\\ncuju. Although details of the rules are not certain, in Zhu Qiu physical\\ncontest and direct confrontation appear to have been lost and a more\\nstylized format adopted. Two goals merged into one. The ball was first\\npassed among the players of one team until it was received by a designated\\nplayer who alone could attempt to shoot at a target. Whether they scored or\\nnot, if the shooting side could keep the ball in the air afterwards they would\\nretain possession and have another go at shooting. If the ball touched the\\nground the shooting initiative passed to the other side. The game was\\ncertainly ubiquitous enough for it to appear in Tales of the Water Margin,\\none of the four classics of Chinese literature. The tales feature a court\\nofficial named Gao Qiu whose senior position in the imperial bureaucracy\\nwas won by his prodigious cuju skills. But cuju did not outlive its Tang and\\nSong patrons. With their decline and the rise of the Ming dynasty (1368-\\n1644 CE) that replaced them, cuju disappears.\\nLike many other Chinese innovations, the ball game appears to have\\nspread along the tracks of imperial expansion and the networks of long-\\ndistance trade routes, land and marine, that radiated out from the Middle\\nKingdom. In the Malay Peninsula, for example, a cross between football\\nand volleyball called Sepak Raga was played with a light rattan ball.

In the\\nhands of the Japanese nobility the game became even more stylized than in\\nChina. Kemari was also known as ‘standing among the trees’.

They had\\nlargely succeeded and in response industrial labour in mines and factories in\\nthe 1870s forced a massive wave of change in the working week. A mixture\\nof parliamentary legislation and local industrial action gained the Saturday\\nhalf-day holiday for many working men.

Under the 2-3-5 formation that had evolved in the 1880s the\\ncentre-half was not a defensive role at all; if anything the position served as\\na kind of primitive playmaker taking the ball out of defence and initiating\\nattacks. Now the centre-half was withdrawn into the defence between the\\ntwo fullbacks and served as an exclusively defensive player often referred\\nto as the ‘stopper’. The other two midfield players in the old system - the\\nwing-halves - could no longer just shadow the opposition’s wingers but\\nwere withdrawn into the genuine midfield and allocated both defensive\\nduties and the task of shuttling the ball out of defence and up to the forward\\nline.\\nUnder 2-3-5 the forward line tended to advance together and did not take\\nup specialized positions or face additional midfield or defensive duties.\\nUnder Chapman, roles, physiques, skills and training for forwards became\\nmore highly differentiated. Wingers were glued to their lines and drilled in\\ncrossing the ball. Centre-forwards needed to be bigger and burlier. The\\ninside-forwards that played between them were the two points at the top of\\nthe M. They were required to link with the defence and be the brains of the\\nteam in attack. Chapman’s Arsenal thus displayed many of the key\\ncharacteristics of modern Fordist production processes: a high degree of\\nspecialization of tasks; systematic, repeatable sequences of tasks; task\\ndesign; close observation and control of players by management.\\nHowever, once the ball was in play Chapman’s sides were expected to\\nshow a degree of spontaneity, reactivity and invention that no production\\nline asked of its workers. In particular Arsenal were the masters of the\\ncounterattack. They would and could concede space to the opposition,\\nfalling back on a highly organized defence, consciously stretching out the\\nother team as they overcommitted players to the front.

The\\nEnglish style was perceived to be supremely physical, bordering on the\\nrough.

Out of this unique\\nconcurrence of football cultures, and under the aegis of the influential\\nVittorio Pozzo, there emerged the notion of a distinct Italian method - il\\nMethodo - later referred to as la Sistema - the system. The Italian\\ncontribution was twofold. First, Italian football possessed a nomenclature of\\nplaying positions of a complexity and precision that would have appeared\\nquite alien in England. For example, Italian foot-ball did and continues to\\ndistinguish between various types of fullback: the terzino marcatore - a\\nmarking fullback - and terzino fluidificante - a fullback with licence to roam\\nalongside his less prescribed defensive duties. Second, given the precision\\nand technicality of its language Italian football was much more systematic\\nin its analysis of micro-level tactics than other football cultures: close\\nmarking was prized, the denial of space to playmakers pursued.\\nAlongside these early schools of football we find innovation, emulation\\nand development elsewhere in Europe.

In 1924 the Swedish FA was\\nable to establish a national league for the first time, though over the next\\ntwenty years every title but two went to teams from the more industrialized\\nwest coast. While before the First World War the Swedish press had been\\nrather conservative and aloof in its coverage of football, the emergence of a\\nlarge literate working-class constituency saw new forms of football\\njournalism develop. Newspapers were perhaps the key agents in promoting\\nfootball. Using the same mix of personalized gossip and local rivalry that\\nhad been pioneered in the British press, Swedish papers made football a\\nstaple element of the popular culture of the nation’s cities and many small\\nindustrial towns. The kinds of local patriotism and identification that these\\nconditions encouraged were made even greater by the creation and funding\\nof ‘foundry teams’ like Sandviken, Degerfors and Åtvidaberg. In these\\nsmall towns a single large employer, usually in the metallurgy or forestry\\nsectors, would dominate the economic and social life of the community. In\\nthe face of a rapidly mobilizing working class a combination of class panic\\nand old-fashioned noblesse oblige saw factory owners invest in the local\\nfootball team. In the bigger towns and cities where the economy was more\\ndiverse and this kind of provincial paternalism was ineffective, football,\\nalready divided before the war, crystallized along class lines. In Gothenburg\\nGAIS and Örgryte formed the lower and upper poles of football’s social\\nscale; in Malmö their equivalents were FF and IFK.\\nThe consequences of this enormous growth in Swedish football were\\ntwofold. First, the rational amateurism of the 1910s which had permitted\\nsmall payments in kind and time-off-work money for players in the national\\nteam was systematically undermined. As gate receipts rose, Swedish\\nfootball became riddled with job-fixing schemes for players, lavish drinking\\nescapades, banquets, dinners and other forms of hidden remuneration.\\nSecond, the now massively increased crowds at football became steadily\\nmore voluble, drunk and disorderly. The nation’s first large-scale pitch\\ninvasion occurred at a game between the visiting Scots Airdrieonians and a\\nStockholm team in 1925.

But it does\\nmatter a great deal that we should be free and willing to meet them in\\n“friendly strifes and rivalries of peace”.’1 However, it was becoming\\nincreasingly obvious to political and sporting observers that not everyone\\nagreed. A leader in The Times on the same occasion read, ‘No appearance\\nof, say, Frenchmen in Germany or of Czechs in Austria can wholly be\\ndevoid of meaning to the onlookers. International politics are very deeply\\nrooted in the minds of the average European.’2 And that of course was the\\nproblem. Britain might hold fast to its vision of friendly, depoliticized sport,\\nbut if one’s opponents - those others, those Europeans - did not do so, then\\nthe game was lost. When the British Consul in Turin reported back to the\\nForeign Office in 1928 on the social significance of Italian football, he\\nargued that the Continental viewed matters from a ‘different mental\\nangle’.3\\nAlthough Latin America and Continental Europe had their own small\\nbands of Olympians and their own version of the ‘keep politics out of\\nfootball brigade’, it was the proponents of ‘sport as politics by other means’\\nthat came to set the rules of the game.

His family, like tens of thousands of Moravians,\\nmigrated to Vienna and headed for the grim industrial suburb of Favoriten\\nwhere there was work in the giant brick factories. Sindelar first played for\\nthe youth team at the local club ASV Hertha before Meisl arranged for his\\ntransfer to FK Austria in 1924. He made his international debut in 1926 and\\nplayed well before falling out of favour with the disciplinarian Meisl. Four\\nyears in the international wilderness followed until Meisl was cornered by a\\ngathering of the city’s leading football commentators as he sat in the Ring\\nCafé in 1931. Everyone was arguing for Sindelar’s recall and Meisl\\nchanged his mind. Sindelar played. Scotland were beaten and the\\nWunderteam - already disciplined, organized, hardworking and professional\\n- acquired their playmaker and inspiration, that vital spark of\\nunpredictability.\\nSindelar’s nickname was Der Papierene, literally the man of paper, but\\nperhaps rendered best as ‘the wafer’, for his ability to slip unnoticed though\\nthe tightest defences. There is no footage of Sindelar playing, but for a brief\\ncameo in a corny romance. Perhaps the lack of film has added undue lustre\\nto his career, but the written reports and oral recollections of the player\\nseem consistent. Sindelar, if not the first, was certainly the leading\\nplaymaker in European football. At last here was someone with the time\\nand the confidence to look up, be able to judge the space and time available\\nto every player on the field and select a pass or a move accordingly.\\nSindelar and the teams that he shaped played football with markedly less\\nphysical contact and force than either British or Italian football; it relied on\\nguile, balance and brains.

Its 360-degree flat concrete roof, when viewed\\nfrom the south on the summit of the Corcovado, gave it the irresistible\\nappearance of an alien spaceship that had chosen to park in a wasteland of\\nvacant lots and exposed steel on the poor fringes of Rio’s Zona Norte and\\nCentro. The stadium from Planet Modernity was built with some of the first\\nconcrete to be actually produced in Brazil. The main entrance was a long\\nspace-age ramp with a roof supported by two lines of simple cylindrical\\ncolumns with no nod, not the slightest gesture, to any classical colonnade;\\nlike the hidden steel cantilevers in the roof they were a bold statement of\\nadvanced engineering and minimalist design. The Maracana’s high internal\\narches and buttresses beneath the stands flanked great circular concourses\\nthat swept round the stadium beneath the seating; a people’s sporting\\nboulevard. A Noite wrote, ‘Today Brazil has the biggest and most perfect\\nstadium in the world, dignifying the competence of its people and its\\nevolution in all branches of human activity.’16 Mário Filho wrote that the\\nMaracana gave Brazil a new soul, that it prefigured the awakening of the\\nslumbering giant of Brazilian potential.\\nThe Brazilian team’s preparations were meticulous, cloistered in a special\\ntraining camp for a couple of months before the tournament, serviced by an\\narmy of cooks, clerics and medical staff.

At the same time the Italian army attempted to invade\\nAlbania and Greece and disintegrated in a fog of its own incompetence; its\\nlogistical and technological backwardness cruelly exposed by Italy’s\\nsmaller neighbours. This concurrence of football and warfare stood in sharp\\ncontrast to the experience of the game twenty-five years earlier. Outside of\\nthe armed forces and the prisoner-of-war camps, the First World War had\\nextinguished football in all combatant nations. The Second World War, at its\\npoints of maximum barbarism and destructiveness, could also extinguish\\nthe game: Poland, alone of any major European nation, played no national\\nfootball championship for the entire duration of the conflict. But beyond the\\nmost concentrated firestorms, football continued, formally and informally,\\nnationally and locally. Indeed football was considered important enough\\nthat the German Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop wrote in his early war\\ndiaries that he ‘placed the highest value on German teams appearing abroad\\nand foreign teams coming to Germany’.1 In the quarter of a century since\\nthe first industrialized war both the social significance of football and the\\nnature of warfare had changed.\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, in its leading zones, European football\\nindustrialized, \\neither \\nin \\nthe \\nform \\nof \\ncommercialization \\nand\\nprofessionalization, or it had been taken over by an authoritarian state.

Although the French did not apply the same level of\\nconcentrated government action to the event that Mussolini had mustered in\\n1934, there were considerable funds for the tournament’s stadiums. Parc des\\nPrinces and Stade Colombes in Paris were extended and the former given\\nan art deco façade. Two stadiums in small and geographically peripheral\\ntowns were rebuilt - Stade du Fort Carré in Antibes and the Stade de la\\nCavée Verte in Le Havre - and two completely new stadiums were\\nconstructed: the Stade Vélodrome in Marseilles and the Parc Lescure in\\nBordeaux. The latter is, without question, the most considered architectural\\nresponse in stadium design to the grandiose pomposity of fascist arenas and\\ntheir alliance of concrete modernism with historical duplicity and brutal\\nfuturism. Designed by Jacques D’Welles and Raoul Jourde, Parc Lescure\\nwas a simple straight-sided oval in shape built entirely from reinforced\\nconcrete. Its 360-degree roof, uniquely at the time, required no pillars or\\nsupports, thereby offering unimpeded views around the ground. It was built\\nfrom ribbed concrete sections whose rhythmic undulations echoed the ring\\nof concrete arches that encircled the upper tiers of the stadium. Rather than\\na single domineering tower or other centralizing architectural device, Parc\\nLescure offered more democratic features, most particularly the four\\nviewing platforms built on the ends of the main stands. Like the bridge of\\nan art deco cruise liner, these semi-circular structures were embellished\\nwith curved glass and porthole windows, while behind them metal gantries\\npassed for mast and rigging, on which the floodlights were hoisted and\\nlowered. This kind of quirky architectural pluralism was replicated on the\\noutside of the stadium. The site itself was tightly packed among residential\\nstreets rather than laid out in the opulent emptiness of Albert Speer’s\\nNürnberg or Roma’s Olimpico Complex. Instead of a single monumental or\\ntriumphal entrance Parc Lescure could be accessed from a number of\\npoints: through a simple if monumentally large concrete arch inserted into a\\nterraced street; or via a cluster of small houses around the base of an art\\ndeco tower, encrusted with scarlet mosaics.

In Argentina Manuel\\nGiúdice, coach at Independiente in the early 1960s, had his teams play\\nmuch the same and with considerable success. Independiente won the\\nleague twice in 1960 and 1963 before going on to win two Copa\\nLibertadores, but they were more than a Latino Inter. They took to the field\\nin formation, signalling a V to the crowd with their arms, they played on the\\nmystique of the alcohol massages evaporating through their shirts and their\\nconfidence was unshakeable; they won their first Libertadores by deposing\\nthe champions Santos, coming back from 2-0 down in the Maracanã to win\\n3-2. Argentina’s new defensive football was given a muscular twist by Juan\\nCarlos Lorenzo who coached the national team at the World Cup finals in\\nChile and England.

Two minutes later the Catalans’\\ngoalkeeper fumbled the ball into his own net, and Coluna made it 3-1 just\\ninto the second half. Benfica then saw off a storm of Barcelona chances,\\nshots rebounding off the post and the crossbar, and were champions.\\nThen in 1960 Benfica discovered a prodigious teenage talent through\\ntheir scouting networks in the slums of Mozambique: Eusébio da Silva\\nFerreira. After the predictable tussle between Benfica and Sporting over his\\nsignature, Eusébio signed for Benfica. In autumn 1961 Benfica faced South\\nAmerican champions Peñarol in the Intercontinental Club Cup.

An Italian crowd would applaud the kind of challenge that saves a goal\\neven at the cost of a yellow card, even a red card and dismissal if necessary.\\nWith these tactics and this mindset, Milan would conquer Europe.\\nBoth Milanese teams found domestic success in the 1950s, Milan fielding\\ntheir Swedish forward line of Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils\\nLiedholm, and Inter winning a title with a characteristically defensive\\nmanager, Alfredo Foni. The leap to European and global success was based\\non the same core of resources and relationships that Juventus had pioneered\\nin the 1950s, bringing together wealthy and connected presidents and\\npolitically and sportingly astute technical directors. Milan and Inter then\\nadded charismatic managers. Nereo Rocco, schooled in the art of\\ncatenaccio with smaller teams, was reunited at Milan with technical\\ndirector Gipo Viani, who had himself pioneered the technique in Italy over\\na decade earlier. Together they built a defensive system around Cesare\\nMaldini, created a midfield that worked hard around their single creative\\npasser Gianni Rivera, and possessed a front line that included during the\\n1960s Jimmy Greaves and José Altafini. El Paro‘n (the Boss), as Rocco\\nwas known in the Trieste dialect, was by turns avuncular and an irascible\\nbully. Under his management Milan won the championship in 1962 and the\\nEuropean Cup the following year, courtesy of two brilliant passes from\\nRivera. After a short sabbatical at Torino, Rocco returned to Milan and won\\nthe championship again, the Cup Winners’ Cup and the European Cup,\\nthrashing a rising but unworldly Ajax 4-1 in the 1969 final. This team also\\nhad a spine of steel, demonstrated when they outfought the combative\\nEstudiantes La Plata in the 1969 Intercontinental Club Cup. As Rocco said\\nto his sides, ‘Kick everything that moves; if it is the ball, even better.’\\nInternazionale’s fortunes were transformed by the arrival of Angelo\\nMoratti, a self-made petroleum billionaire, as president in 1955.

At Inter he was\\nunited with Moratti’s money and a fixer and technical director of\\nimpeccable connectedness and dubious practices, Italo Allodi. Over the next\\nseven years they created Il Grande Inter. Herrera, known in Italy as Il Mago\\n(the Magician), was the first manager-as-star in global foot-ball. His origins\\nand age were deliberately shrouded in mystery. He was born on an island\\nsomewhere on the Río de la Plata around the turn of the century. The son of\\na Spanish anarchist, he grew up in poverty in Casablanca, escaped through\\nFrench professional football and then coached there before making his\\ninternational mark by leading Atlético Madrid and Barcelona. Though not\\nalone, he is one of the key creators of Italian football’s hyper-\\nprofessionalism and attention to detail. His rule, though uneven and\\ncombustible, was characteristically dictatorial. The minutiae of the players’\\npersonal lives, diet and conduct were under constant scrutiny. Herrera\\nintroduced the practice of pre-match retreats, completely cocooning a squad\\naway from the press, family and friends in an act of collective meditation\\nand focus that owed something to Herrera’s own Buddhist and yogic\\npractices. Training regimes and expectations of levels of fitness were truly\\ndemanding.\\nHerrera’s grasp of the psychological dynamics of professional football\\nled him to place particular stress on the role of the crowd. He encouraged\\nAngelo Moratti to form and fund travelling clubs of Interisti to support the\\nteam at away games in Italy and on their European adventures - an action\\nthat anticipated the creation of independent ultra groups by some way. To\\nthis mix Herrera added a meticulous if occasionally incomprehensible body\\nof note-taking, theorizing, speaking and writing. Herrera’s mantra was Taca\\nLa Bal - attack the ball - don’t just possess it, use it, make it work for you.\\nIn a remarkable anticipation of the spatial thinking of Dutch football later in\\nthe decade, Herrera instructed, ‘Create empty spaces. In football as in life,\\nin painting, in music, empty spaces and silences are as important as those\\nthat are filled.’15 But if Herrera aspired to a game of open spaces, the\\nreality of his team’s play was a game of closed spaces, locked doors and\\nimpassable barriers.

The Ancient Egyptians certainly had them, though their\\ngames seem to be closer to volleyball and catch. Among the Berbers - the\\npre-Arabic inhabitants of the mountains of North Africa - a kind of softball\\nwith stones can be found.

In 1931 a dreadful run of form saw the club’s board consult a\\nlocal oracle who recommended that they change their name to Kotoko, the\\nAsante word for porcupine and the symbol of an emerging ethnic\\nnationalism. The club had by now become enmeshed with the traditional\\nchieftaincy structure of the Asante people who provided its leading officers\\nfor generations. Hearts of Oak’s affiliation was urban rather than ethnic. As\\nrepresentatives of Accra they were connected to a multi-ethnic urban\\npopulation in which the traditional forms of African authority that operated\\nin the Asante lands had broken down, to be replaced by the new order of the\\nindependent Ghanaian state. The fearsome rivalry between the two clubs\\nwas paralleled by the emergence of two competing football associations -\\none based in Kumasi, the other in Accra - which made the organization of\\nnational competitions increasingly fraught. Similarly, Nkrumah’s Accra-\\nbased CCP government and the Asante chiefs were locked into a conflict\\nwhich centred on control over the cocoa-marketing boards. The boards\\nmonopolized the sale of Ghana’s most precious and taxable commodity.\\nNkrumah’s government needed the revenues to fund their urban\\nconstituency and their development programmes, while the Asante\\nleadership looked to divert funds to both themselves and the Asante peasant\\nfarmers who grew much of the crop. The battle over the FA went to\\nNkrumah as the old officials were levered out and his key appointee Ohene\\nDjan took control of Ghanaian football in a single Accra-based FA.

By the early 1960s Nkrumah had banned\\nethnically based political parties, cowed the trade-union movement and was\\nruling by decree.\\nAs Nkrumah struggled to face down a tide of internal dissent he\\ncontinued to prosper internationally. His radical pan-Africanism became the\\ncommonplace rhetoric of almost every new independent African state. It\\ntook on a concrete institutional form when the Organization of African\\nUnity was founded in Addis Ababa in 1963. Ghana had joined its\\nfootballing counterpart CAF after independence in 1957 and secured the\\nright to host the 1963 Cup of Nations. With a characteristic rhetorical\\nflourish, Nkrumah named the Ghanaian national football team the Black\\nStars, in memory of the ship The Black Star chartered by Caribbean pan-\\nAfrican leader Marcus Garvey in 1922 to take black Americans and\\nCaribbeans back to Africa. Nkrumah’s Black Stars were equipped with\\nforeign coaches and generous government resources. The leading players\\nhad immediate access to Nkrumah himself and a steady supply of gifts,\\ninducements and rewards. The already established Jalco Cup with Nigeria\\nwas soon supplemented by a Nkrumah Cup between all of the newly\\nindependent West African states and the team was sent on diplomatic\\nmissions to play exhibition games at Kenya’s independence celebrations\\nand the accession of Mobutu to the Congolese presidency. But the serious\\nbusiness of winning competitive matches was not ignored. The Black Stars\\nof the era were tested against the most fearsome opposition. In 1962 they\\ntoured Europe playing Fortuna Düsseldorf, Dinamo Moscow, Austria\\nVienna and Blackpool. In early 1963 they achieved a 3-3 draw with Real\\nMadrid and beat Italy 5-2. The final element in the mix was Nkrumah’s\\ndetermination to rid the Black Stars of the last traces of colonial\\ndependence and domination - a European coach would not be acceptable.\\nNkrumah turned to Ghana’s only overseas professional - CK Gyamfi, who\\nplayed in Germany - to lead the team at the Cup of Nations. The planning\\npaid off and although Nkrumah was too worried by the threat of\\nassassination to attend Ghana’s opening game or indeed the final, he was\\ndelighted to reap the rewards of Ghana’s flowing play and a decisive 3-0\\nvictory over Sudan to lift the trophy.\\n', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\sebarro04\\\\Dev\\\\Rag-System-Project\\\\docs\\\\knowledge-database\\\\documents\\\\The ball is round.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\sebarro04\\\\Dev\\\\Rag-System-Project\\\\docs\\\\knowledge-database\\\\documents\\\\The ball is round.pdf', 'page': 555, 'total_pages': 1193, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'The Ball is Round', 'author': 'David Goldblatt', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': '', 'creationDate': \"D:20240606005724+00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240606005724+00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

In 1964 Ghana\\nbecame a one-party state under Nkrumah’s CPP and the new order had its\\nown club in the national league. Sports minister Ohene Djan created the\\nReal Republikans in 1962 by taking the two best players from the leading\\nteams of the Ghanaian league and appointed an Englishman, George\\nAinsley, as their coach. Protests from the clubs were muted for the most\\npart, but Asante Kotoko complained vociferously. The regime was\\nsufficiently tough minded to threaten to expel them from the league and to\\ncreate a surrogate club on their patch - Kumasi United - to replace them if\\nneed be. In the end, Kotoko like the rest of the Asante elite temporarily\\nacceded to Nkrumah’s demands. In their first season in the league, the\\nRepublikans played on a non-competitive basis. Like their President they\\nwere supposed to be above the interest-ridden conduct of winning points\\nand controlling power. Teams could take points off of them in a game, but\\nthey would take none themselves. This of course was not enough and in\\ntheir second season as one-party rule became more deeply entrenched and\\nmore bitterly resented, they played for real and won the league.

The Real Republikans had been named in emulation of\\nReal Madrid and only the creation and domination of a pan-African\\ntournament would allow them to measure themselves adequately against the\\nEuropean domination that Madrid had exercised in the late 1950s.

Havelange won by 68 votes to\\n52.

When Saporta told him that there were\\nno tickets left for the VIP section, Havelange is reported to have closed the\\nwindows, drawn the blinds, locked the door and spoken: I can stay here for\\nseventy-two hours without having a piss, a shit, food or sleep.

Three further contrasts with Africa suggest why.\\nFirst, Asia’s encounter with European colonialism was profoundly\\ndifferent from Africa’s. Although European power was often blunted,\\neluded or subverted in Africa, no African society was able effectively to\\nresist the force of European arms. Africa paid for the military weakness of\\nits states with a hundred years of servitude. Asia, by contrast, had generated\\nimperial powers and state machines of sufficient resilience, agility and\\nmilitary strength that they could resist. China, although partitioned and\\ncorralled, was never fully subdued. Even though the Japanese were shaken\\nfrom their developmental torpor and geographic isolation by the West, they\\nwere not conquered. Siam-Thailand remained independent and India, even\\nunder British rule, barely deviated from its own internal ruling beliefs and\\nideas. In this context, modern sports which appeared an inevitable fact of\\nmodern life and progress in Africa were still viewed by many Asian elites as\\ndangerous and distasteful alien practices.\\nA second contrast with Africa concerns the presence of the Americans\\nwho, Liberia aside, played no part in the scramble for Africa, but who from\\nthe mid-nineteenth century onwards had a major stake and presence in East\\nAsia combining missionaries, economic investors and occasionally - in\\nJapan, China, the Philippines and Korea - the armed forces. As a\\nconsequence baseball was a significant competitor to football in these\\nsocieties and the most popular sport for most of the twentieth century in all\\nof them but China. The importance of cricket in South Asia is analogous in\\naccounting for the limited development of football.28\\nA third difference concerns the continent’s experience of warfare. In\\nAfrica war has been a major factor in inhibiting, even terminating, the\\ndevelopment of football.

Latin America’s first elected self-\\nproclaimed Marxist government took power and despite opposition from\\nwithin the army and Congress set about pursuing a strategy of radical but\\nlegal change. The country’s copper industry, coal mines, steel plants,\\nrailways and many of the banks were nationalized. Encouraged by their\\nown government, striking workers and radical trade unions called for\\nfurther takeovers, and the nationalization of Ford and ITT Chile followed.\\nWages were increased, prices were frozen and a massive programme of land\\nreform was initiated. By early 1973 the economy had succumbed to roaring\\ninflation, lines of international credit were closing and the massed ranks of\\nindustrialists, landowners and conservative bureaucrats were sabotaging\\nand contesting every move of the government. Protest in Santiago by\\nsupporters and opponents of the regime was becoming a daily and bitterly\\nfought occurrence. Shut-downs in the copper mines and land occupations\\nby the peasantry were matched by strikes and marches from middle-class\\nassociations such as the architects and the dentists, truck owners and\\nshopkeepers. Inside the army the old constitutionalist chief-of-staff General\\nCarlos Prats was deposed and replaced by General Augusto Pinochet, a man\\nof decidedly different political opinions.

In Zanzibar the ASP and Wananichi Sports Club had the same\\nrelationship. The clubs had offered a convenient front for political meetings\\nduring the colonial era and through their mutual aid and annual cultural\\nfestivals provided an early forum for discussing the union of the two\\ncolonies. In 1965 the two parties merged and Tanzania became a one-party\\nstate. The ideology that would shape that state emerged as the Arusha\\ndeclaration after TANU’s long congress in 1967. Arusha, the single most\\nconsidered and coherent document to emerge from the African socialist\\ntradition, proposed an indigenous and alternative model of development.\\nTanzanian socialism would emphasize the rural over the urban, pursue\\nagricultural reforms and self-reliance, and look to indigenous cultural\\ntraditions rather than colonial imports. It proved, economically and\\npolitically, to be deeply flawed.

Second, the relative significance and prowess of\\nwomen’s football is greater in the US than anywhere else.

For the middle\\nclasses, whose emotional and political disposition had been shaped by the\\nparenting techniques of Dr Spock and the enduring psychic ripples of the\\ncounter culture, America’s dominant professional sports presented a series\\nof problems. American football was too violent, too confrontational and too\\nauthoritarian in its internal structures. Baseball’s high-pressure solitary\\nperformances for pitcher and batter were suspect. Basketball was rapidly\\nbecoming the game of the African-American ghetto. Football offered a\\ngame to the suburbs that could be moulded and made markedly less\\nconfrontational and violent than gridiron. It is worth noting that the\\nparanoia of the American middle classes was so great that heading the ball\\nwas actively discouraged (owing to potential brain damage) and a small\\nindustry emerged attempting to sell protective gear to the enthusiastic\\nheader of the ball. Unlike baseball, football offered a game in which\\nteamwork was at a premium over individual performances and in which the\\nprecious and fragile egos of the players could be protected.\\nFootball was also feminized. Soccer mums took the lead in organizing\\nthe game at a grass-roots level and the number of girls and women playing\\nthe game in organized leagues soared. By 2000 the USA had 7 million\\nregistered female footballers, compared to around 300,000 in Germany, one\\nof the stronger European nations in women’s football.

The limits of\\nCardoso’s neo-liberal project were clearly illuminated by the failure of\\nsuccessive regimes to reform the legal framework of Brazilian football and\\ncreate either financial or administrative transparency. The first attempt had\\nbeen made under President Collor, who had appointed Zico as Sports\\nMinister in 1990. Zico fashioned a limited set of reforms which attempted\\nto bring some order to the chaos of Brazilian football administration and the\\nlaw duly passed the Brazilian Congress in 1993 - but it passed because the\\nchanges merely tinkered with the system. In 1995 Cardoso appointed Pelé\\nas Extraordinary Minister of Sport - though whether the appellation was for\\nfootballing or political reasons was not made clear. Pelé appeared a good\\nchoice not merely because of his prestige but because he had genuinely\\nfallen out with the dominant powers in Brazilian football - Joao Havelange,\\nthe CBF and its president Ricardo Teixeira. In 1993 Pelé and his sports\\ncompany had sought to win the TV rights for Brazilian domestic foot-ball.\\nIt was made very clear during the negotiations that no rights would be going\\nnear anyone who did not deposit a significant chunk of cash in the relevant\\nbank accounts. Pelé refused, went public, protested, won the undying love\\nand support of the reformers within the Brazilian sports media and was then\\ncold-shouldered by the establishment. Havelange was so furious that in an\\nact of calculated spite he refused to invite Pelé to the 1994 World Cup draw.\\nPelé spent most of his four-year tenure as minister drawing up what\\nbecame known as the Pelé Law. Taking the Zico Law as its basis, the Pelé\\nLaw sought to force clubs to open their books, and convert from charitable\\nor social-club status to private limited companies. The law also attempted to\\nsystematize and regulate players’ contracts in their favour and force the\\nchaotic organization of Brazilian football to be more rational and open -\\nespecially on the question of the control of leagues and competitions. After\\nmuch argument, the law was passed by Congress in 1998 but the football\\nlobby of club presidents and administrators doing a little politics on the side\\neffectively emasculated the legislation, forcing changes, rewrites and whole\\nsections to be dropped.\\nOne section that was not lost was the regulations allowing foreign\\ncompanies to invest in Brazilian football clubs.

Only the fans were faithful to the\\ncolours - an association so profoundly powerful that even Coca-Cola’s\\nbranding department had to bow before it. When Coke were Boca’s\\nsponsors, their advertising at the stadium appeared uniquely in blue and\\nyellow rather than their own (and River Plate’s) red and white.

Against Turkey they showed they could\\nmatch a tough technical team with both skill and trickery: Rivaldo’s dive\\nafter being hit on the leg by a ball rather than in the face by a hand was\\nperhaps the most disgraceful and certainly the most blatant act of cheating\\nin the tournament. Belgium were dispatched in the second round though\\nonly with Brazil’s full dose of tournament luck, but England who held a\\nshort lead were dismembered even with Brazil down to ten men after\\nRonaldinho had been unfairly dismissed. Turkey in the semi-final was a taut\\nand brilliantly close reprise of the first-round game. It was settled by the\\nsmallest of margins: a few seconds of exceptional, coiled acceleration over\\na few metres by Ronaldo. With three Turkish defenders around him, this\\nminuscule burst of pace was enough to open up a narrow space for a low\\nshot.\\nBy contrast the final was easy. Germany, who had played badly but\\ncrawled their way to the final, offered plausible resistance and organization\\nbut Ronaldo, now in extraordinary form, was not to be denied his and\\nBrazil’s moment of redemption.

Indeed by 2005 President Uribe in\\nColombia was the only head of state in South America that came\\nunambiguously from the Right. The political complexion of the continent\\nwas transformed by the ideological and practical exhaustion of the Latin\\nAmerican Right, their glaring economic and social failures and a weary\\nmoderation of the Left. The consolidation of democracy was a central\\nconcern for many of these new governments. In Latin America that required\\ntwo things: first, the creation of a more even playing field in economy and\\nsociety, and some reduction in the degree of economic, educational and\\npolitical inequalities between individuals and classes. At current levels,\\ninequality remained so immense that the formal institutions of liberal\\ndemocracy were consistently undermined. Second, the systematic and\\nendemic levels of violence, corruption and clientelism in all their many\\nforms, which manipulated and distorted social and sporting life, needed to\\nbe reduced.

He was found guilty at his trial in 2002, imprisoned for a year and\\nordered to repay the money. But this laudable episode of transparency has\\nbeen fatally undermined by the conduct of the Ghanaian FA itself. In July\\n2001 Ghana played Nigeria in Port Harcourt in a key World Cup qualifying\\nmatch. Ghana were on a seventeen-year unbeaten run against their long-\\nstanding anglophone adversaries in West Africa. Liberia were at that time\\nthe top of the qualifying group and Nigeria needed to win to make it to\\nKorea and Japan in 2002. Nigeria got their three points but it was later\\nrevealed that the governor of River State passed $25,000 to Ben Koufie,\\npresident of the Ghanaian FA, before the match. The cash was shared out\\namong administrators and the Ghanaian press corps in the team’s hotel.\\nWhen questioned about the money Koufie managed a level of faux naivety\\nwhich was breathtaking even by the shameless standards of Ghanaian\\nfootball administration: ‘I initially refused the money because of the\\nrumours and suspicions . . . But I changed my mind after the Nigerian\\ngovernor said that it is part of their tradition to extend hospitality with such\\na donation.’4\\nIn Libya football was not entangled with the process of internal\\ndemocratization.

       " 'Football, at the very least, requires feet.',\n",
       " 'The emergence of bipedal hominids, whose feet and hands are sufficiently differentiated that they can trap and kick or catch and throw rather than paw, pad or shove, can be dated to around 2 million years ago.',\n",
       " 'The world is somewhat older.',\n",
       " 'And the ball?',\n",
       " 'Let us forgive Blatter his carelessness with the archaeological record, for there is no evidence of any human manufactured sphere that could be kicked before 2000 BCE.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps those stitched ancient Egyptian balls were kicked, but the hieroglyphic and mural evidence only shows throwing.',\n",
       " 'No doubt, people have been kicking fruit and gourds for longer, rocks and pebbles at a pinch, skulls perhaps and any manner of the roughly spherical objects that the world throws up.',\n",
       " 'Of course they have, it is an irresistible act; to spy the object, to imagine its future trajectory, to shape and balance one’s body and then to take a mighty swing.',\n",
       " 'Better still there comes the delicious moment of impact and the always extraordinary sensation of energy and motion passing from one’s leg to the inanimate object.',\n",
       " 'It soars into the air.',\n",
       " 'It scuds across the ground.',\n",
       " 'It finds its target or perhaps it bounces, tumbling, spinning on an unimagined course.',\n",

       " 'It has no rules and no obvious purpose.',\n",
       " 'It is not a contest or a trial.',\n",
       " 'It contains no strategy or tactics.',\n",
       " 'Yes, it is pleasure and wonder and experiment, but if this is football, then peek-a-boo is drama.',\n",
       " 'This is not to say that football is not a form of playing, or that even in its most modern, structured, commercialized forms that it does not draw upon the same spirit of play that animates a Neolithic rock-kicker.',\n",
       " 'But football is the game modernity plays and the gulf between the modern world and prehistory, between sport and play, is so vast, so punctured by profound transformations in the organization of human life, that to declare an unbroken lineage between the two is to embrace an historical perspective only to render it utterly vacuous.',\n",
       " 'Undaunted, Mr Blatter has had another stab at constructing football’s prehistory.',\n",
       " 'He chose to make his intervention in the debate in a speech at the Beijing Football Expo 2004, an international bazaar devised to bring together the sporting-industrial complex of companies that create the game’s elaborate infrastructure and the global and national bureaucrats and officials that run it.',\n",
       " 'Blatter said, ‘We honour the Chinese people for their country’s role as the cradle of the earliest forms of football, having firmly planted the roots of our sport and helping set the course for it to grow into the beautiful game it is today.’ A statement which received a chorus of coordinated support from the Chinese Sports Ministry and the Asian Football Confederation.',\n",
       " 'Blatter is at least on firmer ground here than on his excursion into the prehistory of play.',\n",
       " 'Certainly, the China created and ruled by the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 221 CE) widely played a game called cuju, simply translated as kick-ball.',\n",
       " 'The technological and social precocity of ancient China is not in doubt; the Chinese invented a lot of things first.',\n",
       " 'The emergence of settled societies, cities and social hierarchies provided the framework in which spontaneous play could be organized into rule-bound contests, and China came to all of these things early.',\n",
       " 'In the initial attempts by nationalist historians of the 1920s and 1930s to write a Chinese history of sport these truths were applied to football.',\n",
       " 'Claims based on stories of the cuju-playing Yellow Emperor dated his political and sporting career as early as the third millennium BCE.',\n",
       " 'The claims however were an attempt to give historical foundation to mythology, relying on legendary epics written just before the emergence of the great Han dynasty in the second century BCE.',\n",
       " 'It seems most likely that cuju, although played in the era of the Warring States (in the third and fourth centuries BCE), was first formalized as an organized sport under the Han.',\n",
       " 'The game was played with a stitched leather ball stuffed with fur or feathers, though some accounts suggest hemp.',\n",
       " 'There were two teams on a marked pitch with goals at the two ends.',\n",
       " 'It appears handling and rough tackling were allowed, but kicking was an important form of propulsion.',\n",
       " 'In some accounts the goal was moon- or crescent-shaped, in others it was described as a hole in a silk sheet hung between bamboo posts.',\n",
       " 'The game was clearly popular among the Royal Household - Emperor Wu Di has been described as both enthusiast and expert.',\n",
       " 'But the game’s home was most likely to have been in the army where it became an element of both training and recreation; some suggest that it warded off the leg numbness suffered by cavalry after a long ride.',\n",
       " 'Under the subsequent imperial dynasties - the Tang (618-907 CE) and the Song (960-1279 CE) - the game continued to be played but its form changed.',\n",
       " 'The ball itself was transformed as players adopted the more technologically advanced but less physically robust hollow ball.',\n",
       " 'It was easier to control, but less suited to combative mêlée.',\n",
       " 'It may be that the new ball was only accessible to the rich, which would help explain the linguistic and formal separation of the common or popular game Bai Da and the courtly game Zhu Qiu.',\n",
       " 'Bai Da was closer to the original Han version of cuju.',\n",
       " 'Although details of the rules are not certain, in Zhu Qiu physical contest and direct confrontation appear to have been lost and a more stylized format adopted.',\n",
       " 'Two goals merged into one.',\n",
       " 'The ball was first passed among the players of one team until it was received by a designated player who alone could attempt to shoot at a target.',\n",
       " 'Whether they scored or not, if the shooting side could keep the ball in the air afterwards they would retain possession and have another go at shooting.',\n",
       " 'If the ball touched the ground the shooting initiative passed to the other side.',\n",
       " 'The game was certainly ubiquitous enough for it to appear in Tales of the Water Margin, one of the four classics of Chinese literature.',\n",
       " 'The tales feature a court official named Gao Qiu whose senior position in the imperial bureaucracy was won by his prodigious cuju skills.',\n",
       " 'But cuju did not outlive its Tang and Song patrons.',\n",
       " 'With their decline and the rise of the Ming dynasty (1368- 1644 CE) that replaced them, cuju disappears.',\n",
       " 'Like many other Chinese innovations, the ball game appears to have spread along the tracks of imperial expansion and the networks of long- distance trade routes, land and marine, that radiated out from the Middle Kingdom.',\n",
       " 'In the Malay Peninsula, for example, a cross between football and volleyball called Sepak Raga was played with a light rattan ball.',\n",
       " 'It has recently been formalized and modernized as Sepak Takraw - a compromise between the Malay word for kick and the Thai word for ball - but its roots are at least four hundred years old and derive from its Chinese counterpart.',\n",
       " 'Medieval Japan played kemari.',\n",
       " 'Although Japanese nationalist historians have insisted on its indigenous origin as far back as the sixth century BCE, the earliest documented writing on the game dates from the twelfth century.',\n",
       " 'The form of the game is clearly related to the courtly version of cuju that the Song had been playing half a millennium before this.',\n",
       " 'In the hands of the Japanese nobility the game became even more stylized than in China.',\n",
       " 'Kemari was also known as ‘standing among the trees’.',\n",
       " 'The playing space was a six- or seven-metre dirt square demarcated by four trees placed at its corners.',\n",
       " 'These could be cherry, willow or maple but pine trees were considered to have the highest status.',\n",
       " 'Eight players would take the field, standing in pairs on either side of the trees.',\n",
       " 'The ball was hollow, light and made of deerskin, often coated white with albumen or dyed yellow by smoke from a pine needle fire.',\n",
       " 'The courtiers with the highest social status would kick-off and the players would simply try and keep the ball in the air as long as possible and used the trees to bounce it off, their branches pruned and trained to provide a path back on to the court for the ball.',\n",
       " 'If a formal count of successful kicks and passes was being carried out, the official responsible could award extra kicks for particularly impressive or stylish plays.',\n",
       " 'Individuals were admired for their ball skills, but also their attention to the etiquette and traditions of the game.',\n",
       " 'A day’s kemari was best ended by a single high kick from the most senior player gracefully caught in the folds of his kimono.',\n",
       " 'Kemari became an important pastime amongst the Japanese elite in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.',\n",
       " 'The first masters of the game appeared, wrote down the rules and displayed unheard-of levels of excellence.',\n",
       " 'Retired and active emperors Goshirakawa and Gotoba became noted enthusiasts and participants.',\n",
       " 'Distinct schools or houses of kemari emerged with their own take on training, technique and rules.',\n",
       " 'Gotoba himself first set down the sartorial regulations covering the game, specifying the colour and pattern of playing socks according to social rank and kemari skill.',\n",
       " 'The game continued to be represented in Japanese art and literature throughout the Tokagowa Shogunate and into the nineteenth century.',\n",
       " 'But while kemari proved longer lived than cuju it was no more able to capture the imagination of a modernizing society.',\n",
       " 'Within a few years of the Meiji Restoration (1868) and Japan’s headlong drive for industrialization kemari had shrunk to a minority pastime of a minority social caste of aristocrats reduced to lobbying the emperor and government to preserve this fragment of the country’s feudal past.',\n",
       " 'Although some imperial patronage was dispensed the game was virtually extinguished by the end of the Second World War.',\n",
       " 'So are cuju and its descendants the ancestors of football as Mr Blatter and the Chinese sports bureaucracies claim?',\n",
       " 'What really marks these sports out in the ancient history of ball games was that they were primarily, though probably not exclusively, kicking games.',\n",
       " 'Yet this preference for the foot over the hand or any other part of the body to propel the ball does not make cuju or kemari unique or even the most venerable.',\n",
       " 'Among the Aboriginal Australians of what is now Victoria State, Marn Gook has been played for millennia.',\n",
       " 'Accounts written by white Australians in the 1840s suggest that it was predominantly a kicking game.',\n",
       " 'The Pacific Islands societies of Polynesia and Micronesia had their own indigenous kicking games with balls made from wrapped Pandanus leaves.',\n",
       " 'Native Americans played many large-scale team ball games and showed a general disinclination to use their hands, preferring bats and feet.',\n",
       " 'William Strachey, the first colonial governor of Virginia, described one game as: a kynd of exercise that have often amongst them much like that which boyes call bandy in English and may be aunceynt game.',\n",
       " 'They have the exercise of Footeball, in which yet they only forceibly encounter with the foote to carry the Balle the one from the other, and spurne it to the goale with a kind of dexterity and swift footmanshippe, which is the honour of it.',\n",
       " 'Does that make these games and cultures the ancestors of football?',\n",
       " 'Marn Gook is likely to be as old as and probably older than cuju.',\n",
       " 'The Native Americans continued to play their games of football long after the Ming had abandoned theirs.',\n",
       " 'They also continued to play the ball horizontally, passing it towards a goal.',\n",
       " 'While early forms of cuju appear to take this form, its refined courtly versions as well as kemari play the ball upwards.',\n",
       " 'The switch from the horizontal to the vertical as the main axis of movement was perfectly in tune with the shifting culture of the times.',\n",
       " 'Late medieval China and Japan closed their doors to the world until Americans and Europeans forced them to open them again in the nineteenth century.',\n",
       " 'Expansive territorial imperatives were abandoned for the delicate maintenance of vertical hierarchy.',\n",
       " 'The price of over three hundred years of glorious internal order was social, military and technological inferiority; and that is why whatever the similarities of Han cuju or Marn Gook to football, neither can claim its origins.',\n",
       " 'What has ultimately determined which game modernity plays is not who played a kicking game earliest, nor even who kept the ball on the ground for longest, but who played the game at the moment of modernization.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps, in an alternative history, in which China or Japan had industrialized before or alongside Europe, a sizeable portion of the world, at least in Asia and the Pacific, would be playing an alternative football code of their own.',\n",
       " 'But they did not.',\n",
       " 'The pallid remnants of cuju and kemari were, like the elites that still played them, swept aside by the whirlwind of East Asia’s encounter with modernity.',\n",
       " 'The Chinese Tang imperial household may have dabbled in cuju but they revelled in polo.',\n",
       " 'Roman senators might have warmed up in the gym with a game of catch but the slaughter at the Coliseum was the centre of their sporting world.',\n",
       " 'Competitive ball games are present in nearly all the cultures of the ancient world, but only in Mesoamerica did the ball game take centre stage.',\n",
       " 'In this respect the sporting universe of the modern world is closer to that of the cultures that lived in what is now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras; the ball game was the only game.',\n",
       " 'For 3,000 years, between the emergence of the Olmecs in Central Mexico and the fall of the Aztecs to the Spanish conquistadors in 1521, every society in Mesoamerica, every settlement from the great city of Teotihulucan to the scattered village compounds of the Gulf of Mexico played the game.',\n",
       " 'The material archaeological record left behind cannot quite match the singular splendour of the Coliseum or Olympia but its breadth is unparalleled.',\n",
       " 'Over 1,500 ball courts have been unearthed, from tiny plain rectangular troughs in small villages and ancient hilltop towns to the vast and elaborate stepped constructions of the great Mayan city of Chichen Itza.',\n",
       " 'Many more must have been lost to the jungle or were destroyed by the Spanish occupation.',\n",
       " 'In addition, the ruined ball courts and ransacked tombs have yielded an extraordinary trove of ceramic figurines, glyphs, carvings, reliefs and statues that depict the game and its rituals.',\n",
       " 'The mythological record is even stronger.',\n",
       " 'The Popul Vuh is the defining written document of the Qiche Mayan cultures that ruled over southern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala from around 800 to 1400 CE.',\n",
       " 'It consists of three parts.',\n",
       " 'The first is the story of creation.',\n",
       " 'The third is a dynastic history of the Mayan nobility.',\n",
       " 'At the heart of the text, sandwiched between the two, is an account of the creation of the sun and the moon and with it all the dualities around which Mesoamerican life was organized: light and dark, day and night, good and evil, life and death.',\n",
       " 'Its chief protagonists are the hero twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque.',\n",
       " 'The twin’s forefathers were the brothers Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu.',\n",
       " 'Both were ball players of considerable repute whose noisy game disturbed the gods of the underworld.',\n",
       " 'The Dark Lords of Xibalba opened a portal on to the brothers’ court and tricked them into entering their realm.',\n",
       " 'There they challenged them to a game.',\n",
       " 'The mortals lost and were immediately sacrificed, their bodies buried in the subterranean court and the head of Hun Hunahpu humiliatingly displayed on a calabash tree.',\n",
       " 'When the goddess Xquic passed the tree Hun Hunahpu’s dismembered head spat in her hand.',\n",
       " 'The goddess was impregnated and when her pregnancy was discovered by the Xibalba lords she was banished to the upper world.',\n",
       " 'Here she gave birth to the hero twins.',\n",
       " 'The demi-god brothers proved to be divine ball players and once they reached adulthood were summoned to the underworld for the second leg of this intergenerational encounter.',\n",
       " 'On and off the court the twins proved a match for their immortal foes and escaped back to earth with their father and uncle’s bodies, exhumed from the diabolical ball court.',\n",
       " 'The corpses were placed in the sky to become the sun and the moon.',\n",
       " 'It is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on this.',\n",
       " 'These are not ancillary elements of Mesoamerican culture, a mere addendum to their central myths and narratives; they are at the core of their whole structure of belief.',\n",
       " 'How can it be that a ball game provided the physical and symbolic fulcrum of an entire continental culture?',\n",
       " 'We could ask a similar if secularized question of our own world.',\n",
       " 'What appeared to strike the Spanish most of all on seeing the game for the first time was the ball and how it moved.',\n",
       " 'Columbus brought examples back to the Spanish court for investigation.',\n",
       " 'Royal chronicler Pedro Mártir de Anglería was flum-moxed: ‘I don’t understand how when the balls hit the ground they are sent into the air with such incredible bounce.’ Mesoamerica alone had balls that bounced, because it alone had rubber.',\n",
       " 'Today rubber can be found all over the tropics but prior to the conquest it was indigenous to the forests of Mesoamerica.',\n",
       " 'But rubber plants are not enough alone to make the ball.',\n",
       " 'In the earliest settled communities of the second millennium somebody had to have the wit and the luck to mix the latex juice of the plant with the roots of the morning glory flower.',\n",
       " 'What they got was a botanical form of vulcanization that created a solidified, elastic, jumping ball.',\n",
       " 'When all you have known are pebbles and squashes, who wouldn’t want to play with that?',\n",
       " 'The playful energies of these ancient Mesoamericans must have been so intensely stimulated, so unreservedly released by the quicksilver bounce of the rubber ball that the game itself became sacred; a portal into the world of magical energies.',\n",
       " 'Archaeological fragments suggest that ball manufacture had begun as early as 1500 BCE, but it was around 1200 BCE that the expanding Olmec Empire, with its emergent cities, public architecture and hierarchical religious and political institutions, provided the context in which the rubber ball and the insatiable desire to play with it could be framed by settled rules to create a contested team game.',\n",
       " 'The Olmec version of the ball game contained all of its lasting characteristics.',\n",
       " 'The courts the game was played on were invariably part of a larger public space or temple complex.',\n",
       " 'They were either rectangular or a capital I-shaped, flanked by high sloping whitewashed walls and often richly decorated with brightly coloured murals.',\n",
       " 'The very biggest complexes would have further levels of stepped stone serving as seating for a considerable audience.',\n",
       " 'The rubber ball, varying in size between a large softball and a small basketball, moved back and forth across a central line between two competitors or two teams.',\n",
       " 'From the protective clothing worn by players in sculpture and pictures, it seems that the ball was struck with some combination of forearms, shins, shoulders, buttocks and hips.',\n",
       " 'The heavy speeding ball would have been dangerous and difficult to control with the head or bare feet.',\n",
       " 'The aim appears to have been akin to modern volleyball: to keep the ball aloft in one’s own half or restrict it to a limited number of bounces before returning it to one’s opponents.',\n",
       " 'The precise form and meanings of the ball game changed over the next 3,000 years.',\n",
       " 'In the smaller cities of Pacific Mexican civilization, at their height around the second century BCE, the game was played at village level in modest courts.',\n",
       " 'In the city-state of Teotihulucan three centuries later, the game was restricted to the elite who played with bats and sticks.',\n",
       " 'Among the Maya the game’s ritual and religious dimension peaked, while the greatest enthusiasts for just playing were probably the civilizations of Vera Cruz on the Caribbean coast whose urban ruins are studded with simple ball courts.',\n",
       " 'The game even spread east to the island societies of what is now Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and to the north it was taken up by the Hohokum Indian cultures of Arizona.',\n",
       " 'The Aztecs, who knew the game as Tchatali, added decorated stone rings to the side of a court, and awarded the game to those who could send the ball through them.',\n",
       " 'The geographical spread of the ball game was matched by its social depth.',\n",
       " 'From its inception the game was entwined with other features of Mesoamerican life.',\n",
       " 'The sheer number of courts and ubiquity of objects indicated that the game was played informally by commoners as well as ritually by the elite.',\n",
       " 'Aztec and Mayan records even point to the emergence of highly skilled players from the lower classes competing with nobles.',\n",
       " 'The meaning of the game was tied to the complex systems of astronomy and calendrical time around which these societies were organized.',\n",
       " 'The patron deity of the Aztec game was Xolotl who appeared in the night sky as Venus, and players appear in murals as representatives of other cosmic bodies.',\n",
       " 'Statuettes and carvings show that the game was often accompanied or preceded by dramatic performances, and that gambling was rife.',\n",
       " 'A number of Mesoamerican cultures record accounts of the nobility wagering their land and their tributary authority on the outcome of a game.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes a substitute for war, the game could also provide its denouement as defeated opponents first played the game before being sacrificed - their heads cut off or their hearts torn out.',\n",

       " 'In 1528 Hernando Cortés was sufficiently intrigued to take ball players and equipment back to the court of King Charles V of Spain, where his captive athletes performed for the Castilian nobility.',\n",

       " 'The Spanish suppressed the game.',\n",
       " 'They needn’t have bothered: the introduction of Eurasian diseases into the continent, the enslavement of much of the population and the forced Christianization of those that survived were easily enough to destroy the societies and beliefs that sustained the ball game.',\n",

       " 'The legal structure of football clubs was a grey area at first, but most appeared to fall under the legal rubric of charitable and voluntary organizations.',\n",
       " 'However, as clubs grew and needed to take on considerable debt to fund their expansion and the creation of football stadiums, there was a steady conversion of clubs into private limited companies (that could take on debt) with private shareholders (providing some of the capital).',\n",

       " 'The most significant form of control that clubs exercised over players was through the retain-and-transfer system.',\n",
       " 'Clubs held or retained players’ professional playing licences and a player could only play for the club that held that licence.',\n",
       " 'Of course the licence could be bought and sold for a transfer fee and the obsessive pursuit of talent saw the value of a player’s licence steadily climb.',\n",
       " 'Middlesbrough were the first to pay £1,000 for a player - Alf Common - in a desperate bid to avoid relegation in 1905.',\n",
       " 'This system prevented player poaching but the club retained absolute control over where a player could play.',\n",
       " 'The possibility of escalating wages in pursuit of the best squads, with all the implications that had for the concentration of talent in a few clubs and generalized wage inflation, was registered early on by football’s administrators.',\n",

       " 'The rest of the pitch would be steadily encircled with a raised embankment of some kind to provide a vantage point for standing spectators.',\n",
       " 'Some clubs went so far as to invite the dumping of waste and spoil to build this up.',\n",
       " 'When Fulham FC were building Craven Cottage they used street sweepings, while many clubs in mining areas used slag and ashes.',\n",

       " 'When Sunderland proudly unveiled Roker Park, the event was marked with marching pipe bands and a flotilla of steamboats on the River Wear with Lord Londonderry as master of ceremonies.',\n",
       " 'Roker Park’s architect was the Scottish engineer and draughtsman Archibald Leitch, and it was Leitch more than anyone else who defined the nature of the early industrial football stadium.',\n",
       " 'Leitch made his name in Scotland where his engineering practice specialized in the design and construction of factories and warehouses; utilitarian and cost-effective models of design that appealed to the impecunious directors of football clubs looking to expand their capacities at the lowest possible cost.',\n",
       " 'Leitch was responsible for the first great wave of stadium building in Glasgow, including Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park.',\n",
       " 'He then moved on to projects in the north of England and the midlands including Roker Park and Middlesbrough’s Ayrsome Park in the north-east, Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough, Blackburn Rovers’ Ewood Park, Bolton’s Burnden Park, Aston Villa’s Villa Park and Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Molyneux.',\n",
       " 'Leitch’s work was so popular that he finally reached the south coast, designing Southampton’s The Dell and Portsmouth’s Fratton Park, while in London Leitch was also responsible for parts of Stamford Bridge (Chelsea), White Hart Lane (Tottenham) and Craven Cottage (Fulham).',\n",
       " 'Leitch’s early work created an enclosed stadium that had a covered, seated grandstand on one long side of the pitch and open terraces on the other three.',\n",
       " 'As the ambitions of both clubs and designer grew, Leitch innovated by producing two-tier grandstands, some with seating above and standing below, others all seated; and, in his later efforts, he created stadiums with cover on all four sides of the ground and seating and standing on each side as well.',\n",
       " 'Though his work was not austere, it had a certain functionality about it, leavened only by a number of trademark details including criss-cross iron work on grandstand balconies, gabled roofs and pediments.',\n",
       " 'Yet for all the functional eloquence of the stadium, Leitch and his contemporaries built a very low-tech, low-cost infrastructure.',\n",
       " 'There was little appetite for experiment or aesthetic innovation among the patrons of the game and the directors of the board.',\n",
       " 'Floodlights were tried in a variety of forms - strung across and along the side of pitches at Bramall Lane, Sheffield in the 1870s, for example - but not followed up.',\n",
       " 'Nor was there the same kind of ideological aesthetic that would shape the stadium-building programmes of fascist and communist Continental Europe in the inter-war era.',\n",
       " 'Like the industrial revolution that gave birth to British football, its fixed capital assets were functional but crude, initially effective but quickly obsolete, a model for others but soon superseded.',\n",
       " 'So who were the huddled masses, the crowds that filled Leitch’s stands and terraces?',\n",
       " 'The architectural division of his and other early English grounds into covered and uncovered, seated and unseated, cheap and expensive areas probably provides the most accurate indicator of the crowd’s social make-up.',\n",
       " 'There was always a small tranche of middle-class supporters in the best seats, perhaps 10 per cent of the total.',\n",
       " 'At the centre of the pavilion or grandstand there would be the club’s directors and civic dignitaries - often symbolically separated by the creation of some kind of barrier, though the hermetically sealed executive box was yet to be invented.',\n",
       " 'The other 90 per cent of the ground was filled by what contemporaries would have called a mix of the rough and the respectable.',\n",
       " 'It seems likely that the bulk of those on the terraces were drawn from the lower middle classes - especially young single men - and the skilled working classes; if only because most contemporary reports, observational rather than statistical, say precisely this.',\n",
       " 'The only actual record of a crowd’s occupations is a somewhat morbid document - the list of the dead in the 1902 Ibrox disaster - and this confirms the observers’ reports.',\n",
       " 'The commitment and income of these social groups was such that the Football League was able to raise admission prices to 6d in 1890, which was more expensive than the cheapest seats at the music hall or later the cinema.',\n",
       " 'That said, it did not put a place on the terraces out of reach for anyone but the very poorest and then there were always ways of smuggling oneself in; security remained fairly lax.',\n",
       " 'Boys were usually charged half-price and made up a small but not inconsiderable portion of the crowd, sometimes given their own enclosure or pen, other times carried aloft over adult heads to the front or even down to the side of the pitch.',\n",
       " 'Initially women were usually granted free entrance, but when over 2,000 came to watch Preston North End in 1884 the club abandoned the practice and others followed suit.',\n",
       " 'By all accounts football grounds were noisy places.',\n",
       " 'The air was rent with violent oaths and swearing though this could be balanced by the spontaneous rendition of hymns from behind the goals.',\n",
       " 'Rattles, drums and other instruments made their way on to the terraces, and tunes, gags and catchphrases from the contemporary music hall repertoire joined them.',\n",
       " 'In much of the photographic record the crowd on the open terraces is dressed in heavy winter coats, mufflers and the ubiquitous flat cap.',\n",
       " 'From around the turn of the twentieth century, and especially for the big games and the Cup ties, rosettes and ribbons in team colours seem to have made their first appearance.',\n",
       " 'Although it is harder to prove from contemporary photographs, there is little doubt that much of the crowd would have had a drink beforehand and during the game too if they were organized enough to have brought a hip flask or a bottle.',\n",
       " 'The behaviour of the crowd, outside of major events of disturbance and disorder, can only be gleaned from the many chance remarks, reports and jottings of the era.',\n",
       " 'Although clearly there were occasional incidents of violence, the most fundamental point to make is that the crowd was overwhelmingly good humoured, well behaved and self-policing, with an immense tolerance for the low standards of comfort and scant regard from the authorities for their sightlines or well-being.',\n",
       " 'There is some suggestion that working-class life of the time inured many to the low-level scuffling and drunken fisticuffs that might break out.',\n",
       " 'There is also a hint of the presence of more organized ruffians and gangs from the worst streets in the toughest cities.',\n",
       " 'But there is very little direct evidence that they were an enduring feature of the late Victorian and Edwardian football crowd.',\n",
       " 'What seems incontestable is the degree of passionate interest, detailed observation and delirious pleasure that foot-ball could evoke in the fans.',\n",
       " 'The hunger for football beyond the raw ninety minutes was soon recognized by the media entrepreneurs of the era.',\n",
       " 'In the 1880s scores for the big matches were almost immediately being telegraphed around the country and from town to town.',\n",
       " 'Youths would gather by pubs and post offices to get the news; shopkeepers would chalk up the current scores of FA Cup Finals.',\n",
       " 'Inevitably a specialized press took shape to cater for this interest.',\n",
       " 'By the late 1880s England possessed three sporting dailies: The Sporting Chronicle, The Sporting Life and The Sportsman.',\n",
       " 'They all covered a multitude of sports, especially horse racing, but were steadily more and more focused on football.',\n",
       " 'The Athletic News was founded in Manchester in 1875 under the irrepressible H. A. H. Catton who turned it into the leading football newspaper of Victorian Britain.',\n",
       " 'It emerged each Monday with coverage of every League game and a reported circulation of 170,000.',\n",
       " 'The local press all over the country were quick to follow as they recognized the passion for the game.',\n",
       " 'Special Saturday-evening editions were printed on coloured paper - and thus known as Pink ’Uns and Green ’Uns - at such extraordinary speed that you could pick one up on the way back from the game.',\n",
       " 'The whole report from the game would have been dictated move by move down the phone as the game developed, ready to go to press on the final whistle.',\n",
       " 'Clubs began to reciprocate interest as they understood the virtuous circle of football and press coverage for the bottom line; the first press facilities specially constructed at a football ground were at Celtic in 1894.',\n",
       " 'The love affair of the press with football was ratcheted up even further when the technology for taking action photographs was perfected and in 1907 the Daily Mail became the first title to make massive use of football photos to report on the game and sell the paper.',\n",
       " 'Dailies and weeklies were soon joined by a variety of other publications, with Charles Alcock’s Football Annual, published every year between 1868 and 1908, defining the genre.',\n",
       " 'Where the press and the public lead, the advertisers cannot be far behind, and the early twentieth-century footballer was used to sell consumer items to the working class.',\n",

       " 'Oxo advertised itself by claiming: ‘Remember the English Cup was won in 1911 for the fifth time in succession by a team trained on Oxo.’ And for those who simply wanted more football rather than football-endorsed beef drinks there was the first flickering of the memorabilia industry in the form of cigarette cards.',\n",
       " 'Although the heyday of football cards was yet to come, after the First World War, the 1890s were notable for the aesthetically pleasing and much sought- after Ogden’s Golden Guinea series.',\n",

       " 'The legal structure of football clubs was a grey area at first, but most appeared to fall under the legal rubric of charitable and voluntary organizations.',\n",
       " 'However, as clubs grew and needed to take on considerable debt to fund their expansion and the creation of football stadiums, there was a steady conversion of clubs into private limited companies (that could take on debt) with private shareholders (providing some of the capital).',\n",
